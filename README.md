# Baby Monitor Smart Cradle

# Overview :

Nowadays one of the most significant challenges that faces many families is baby care.
Parents cannot continuously observe or monitor their babies all the time.
Baby monitors help in reassuring millions of parents that their children are safe.
The idea in This Project is to design a system that will simplify the process of monitoring the baby by using Raspberry Pi device.
Thus, we have come up with an idea to design 
A Smart Cradle System using IOT which will help the Parents to monitor their child
even if they are away from home & detect every activity of the Baby from any distant corner of the world.

# Key Features :

- Measuring the Baby cradle temperature and humidity
- Displaying live video and audio
- Determine if the baby is awake or asleep
- Recording audio and music and playing it to the baby,
- Ability to listen to the baby's noise through sound detection and take action.
